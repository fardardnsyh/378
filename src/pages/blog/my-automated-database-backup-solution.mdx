This post is an overview of my backup solution for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB databases to AWS S3.

***Find the code here: https://github.com/lukeliasi/database-backups-s3***

# How It Works
1. **Define Connection URIs**: Include the database connection string URIs in the configuration.
2. **Schedule Backups**: Set up a Cron expression for scheduling or run on the script startup.
3. **Database Dump**: The script connects to the databases and performs a dump.
4. **Compression and Upload**: Dumps are compressed and uploaded to the connected S3 bucket.

### Supported Databases
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

## Deployment
You can deploy this script in just a few clicks on platforms such as [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io). Simply clone the repo, connect your account to the service, configure your databases and it should be up and running in no time or run it elsewhere by simply running `docker compose up`.
